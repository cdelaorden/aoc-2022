Let's try to Learn Rust!

Running:

`cargo run -- <day> [<path_to_input>]`

If ommited, `<path_to_input>` will default to `inputs/<day_number>.txt` which has the received puzzle inputs. Override for using different inputs or the available `inputs/<day>_test.txt` with the examples.

Run tests (if any ðŸ˜…) with `cargo test`.
